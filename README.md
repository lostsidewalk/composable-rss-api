# composable-rss-api

composable-rss is a multi-user, self-hosted platform that allows you to programmatically create, publish, and manage syndicated web feeds.

This repository contains the API server, which provides HTTP-based REST access to the core syndicated web feed management capabilities of the entire platform. Actions to create, retrieve, update, and delete, both feeds and their payloads on a live running feed server, in real-time or on a scheduled basis, are provided.
